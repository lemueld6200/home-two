Acknowledgements: Huge thanks to the writers and coders over at W3Schools for there insightful examples

The HTML `<br>` tag denotes a line break, like a carriage return in a word processing
program. You'd use it at the end of each line of an address, for example, to get the
block format people are accustomed to seeing.

The `<p>` tag generates a paragraph break. It is applied to a section of text that is
a block of text separated from nearby blocks of text by a blank space and/or first-
line indent.

The `<pre>` tag is used with preformatted text. It instructs the browser that the text
is to appear exactly as written in the HTML file, including any spaces or blank
lines. If you type five spaces inside `<pre>` tags, you get five spaces on the website.
character

The `&nbsp;` character creates a space that does not break into a new line. Two words
that are separated by a non-breaking space always appear on the same line.

The `&#9;` and `&Tab;` characters create tab spaces in HTML. Unfortunately, they can't
be used independently. Any time you want a tab in HTML, you'll either need to use
one of these characters inside `<pre>` tags or fake it with CSS.

You can also add space around text using Cascading Style Sheets (CSS). If you're
looking to create spacing anywhere around a full block of text, this is absolutely
the way to do it. CSS also affords plenty of stylistic controls for the text itself,
making it the first choice for many web developers.
