## Hello there!

#### \* Slide Number on Portfolio

Looking at the header on Portfolio.html, there's a slightly visible 2/6 hiding. It belongs, well used to, to the slideshow that was gonna be on Portfolio.

#### \* 404

For whatever reason, 404 page doesn't show up but rather the redirected too many times page. And for whatever reason Main/Home.html and it's brothers isn't
working. I swear I'm going to bash my head in for this once I find out the itsy bitsy ~~spider~~ bug.

### \* Header + nav Spacing

Fix that weird spacing between the Header and Nav. Look at Home One's original look compared to Home Two. Noticed the obvious spacing? I have no idea what is causing this

## \* Basik Observations and Notes

### \* Progress Tag

An observation on the progress tag, for some reason, whatever reason...
`<progress value="22" max="100"> </progress>`
Gives me a _static_ progress bar and works as I intended, however before doing this...
I originally did `<progress> min"0" max="100" value ="1" </progress>` gives me an ANIMATED progress bar and doesn't adhere to the parameters (seemingly)
Notice where the ">" is located in the first part of the tag? No clue why it goes animated if you put `<progress>` then `<progress (paramaters)>`
But hey! Bet it'll be useful...one day...or something.
