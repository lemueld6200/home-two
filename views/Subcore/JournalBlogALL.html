          <p>
            You're looking at it. This website is what I'm working towards perfecting or at least
            close enough to perfecting. I have so many ideas I wanna make I'm planning on even
            buying a proper domain name for this eventually once I'm on my own two feet eventually.
            It's the kind of project that hooks me on because of the endless possiblities. I'm
            extremely ambitous on this one and I'm hoping to have this project grow as I grow.

          <h5> September 8th, 2019</h5>
          <p>
            Simple yet somewhat effective refresher on getting back to coding for Bunin's CS AP
            class at AFSE. It's been awhile since I touched HTML so it was a welcomed project.
            Though nothing accelerating or really something to write home about. We were somewhat
            introduced to number systems, though honestly the lesson plan is kinda janked and it
            isn't at all informative on what Binary/Hex/Ten was, at the beginning of the lesson
            plan.

          <h5> September 23rd, 2019</h5>
          <p>
            Another simple project that I kinda question the point to sometimes nonetheless...it was
            a Driver and Navigator format, as some of my readers know (hopefully lol) I had a a
            similar experience back to the "first" entry
            <a href="Entry01"> Binary, Hex and Base 10 Table </a>. For this project we were told to
            do a Driver-Navigator approach to making a schedule made of a bunch of arrays.

          <p>
            We had an option to research from a select four choices of articles that all talk about
            different computer innovations. I had researched two "interesting" articles that has
            been laid out for me and my class. I chose Augmented Reality because I am very well
            interested in how AR will impact the future, and I chose Biometrics for the next article
            because I'm someone who's very concerned over Biometrics. And the poenital for abuse and
            privacy issues.</p
