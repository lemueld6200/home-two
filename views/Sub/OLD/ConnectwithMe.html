          <p>
            You are looking at it. This website is what I'm working towards perfecting or at least
            close enough to perfecting. I have so many ideas I wanna make I'm planning on even
            buying a proper domain name for this eventually once I'm on my own two feet eventually.
            It's the kind of project that hooks me on because of the endless possiblities.

            >I even made a design layout that I'm planning on further building on or expanding as I
            program, I just needed something that looked clean and that visualized everything/most
            of the things I wanted to make for this website.

          <p> <b> Q1. </b> "What is your program going to do?" </p>
          <blockquote>
            <b> A1. </b> While most people in my class are likely going to do whatever they can to
            resemble a video game or something near that nature, rather then divide my time on
            another project when I already have this to deal with. I decided to use this
            portfolio/website/blog and to use it for this assingment. Obviously something as
            long-term as this (because I'll be updating very frequently) it'd take a lot of time so
            <i> for now...</i>. This website will be used to be my blog that I'll have to use for
            the entire year, and likely another. And it'll be used to showcase past pet projects
            from my freshmen year in AFSE.
