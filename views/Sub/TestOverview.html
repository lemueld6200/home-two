<!--- Merge Blog Overview with HideBlog...somehow. An overhaul might be in need.
 To visualize epikness. 
Blog, Blog02, Blog03 and Blog04 are being merged under one file called Blog.html
The page buttons will hide the previous sets and show a set of cards, at this point
I should probably increase the set of cards per page to around ten, that way the fitler
that I'm also going to add that comes from BlogOverview be more useful. It's easy to fitler
five cards, but what about ten? Not hard but tedious.

In addition to this, just to peserve the whole view entry button card in Blog and it's children
I was thinking of having that view filter shown on load, and the filter controls be hidden on load.
Clicking the view fitler, obviously hides the button itself, the previous text and shows the button.
In a ideal world, more would be added to the fitler controls. Maybe one day controlling how many
sets show up in a page.--->

      <h2> Entry 00: My Website/Portfolio </h2>
      <h5> September 17th, 2019</h5>
      <p> You're looking at it. This website is what I'm working towards perfecting or at least close enough to perfecting. I have so many ideas I wanna make
      I'm planning on even buying a proper domain name for this eventually once I'm on my own two feet eventually. It's the kind of project that hooks me on because of the
      endless possiblities. I'm extremely ambitous on this one and I'm hoping to have this project grow as I grow. </p>

      <h2> Entry 01: Binary, Hex and Base 10 Table </h2>
      <h5> September 8th, 2019</h5>
      <p> Simple yet somewhat effective refresher on getting back to coding for Bunin's CS AP class at AFSE. It's been awhile since I touched HTML so 
      it was a welcomed project. Though nothing accelerating or really something to write home about. We were somewhat introduced to number systems, though honestly
      the lesson plan is kinda janked and it isn't at all informative on what Binary/Hex/Ten was, at the beginning of the lesson plan. </p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="clickDiv CSAP set1 card" data-href="/Entry/02.html">
      <h2> Entry 02: Technological Innovations </h2>
      <h5> September 15th, 2019</h5>
      <p> Our teacher had us pair in groups and read pre-selected articles on Technological Innovations. Self-driving Automobiles, Swarm Drones
      in Warfare, Pet Robots and Cryptocurrency and summarize what we read. Moments like these make me question what class I'm really in. </p>
    </div>
    
    <div class="clickDiv CSAP set1 card" data-href="/Entry/03.html">
      <h2> Entry 03: Plastic Straw Bridge </h2>
      <h5> September 19th, 2019</h5>
      <p> We shall take a moment of silence, to remember all the unnecessary harmful plastic straws that was bought by our teacher
      that have made their way into the ocean and polluted our great waters. Rest in peace sea-life. Even though this is a "computer science class"
      our teacher had us make the longest straw bridge possible out of...plastic straws. The fact this even got approved is questionable, this 
      has in my opinion little to do with actual coding. I guess this activity was planned to encourage teamwork and communication? Can't think 
      of anything else.</p>

      <h2> Entry 04: Array Schedule </h2>
      <h5> September 23rd, 2019</h5>
      <p> Another simple project that I kinda question the point to sometimes nonetheless...it was a Driver and Navigator format, as some of my readers know (hopefully lol) I had a 
       a similar experience back to the "first" entry <a href="Entry01.html"> Binary, Hex and Base 10 Table </a>. For this project we were told to do a Driver-Navigator approach
       to making a schedule made of a bunch of arrays. </p>

      <h2> Entry 05: Technological Innovations II </h2>
      <h5> September 24th, 2019</h5>
      <p> We had an option to research from a select four choices of articles that all talk about different computer innovations. I had researched two "interesting" articles 
      that has been laid out for me and my class. I chose Augmented Reality because I am very well interested in how AR will impact the future, and I chose Biometrics for the
      next article because I'm someone who's very concerned over Biometrics. And the poenital for abuse and privacy issues.</p>

      <h2> Entry 06: How a Computer is Set-up </h2>
      <h5> September 27th, 2019</h5>
      <p> Bunin's frequent trouble-shooting problem that his students ask him is..."My computer isn't turning on!" "My screen's black." "I plugged
      the cables in and I turned on the monitor but nothing's happeneing!" So he had us "learn" how to set up a computer. By removing every cable
      in the computers in the school's lab and plugging them back in shortly after. </p>

      <h2> Entry 07: Spaceship Adventure Processing </h2>
      <h5> October 2nd 2019 </h5>
      <p> Another pair-programming excercise again but with Processing.
        Bunin forced us to follow a pre-existing sketch of a total of ten steps. Going over how to make a simple spaceship, shape by shape. 
        My program is simply to render that pre-existing sketch in my own written code.  </p>

      <h2> Entry 08: The Eclipse Super Star Destroyer! </h2>
      <h5> October 7th 2019 </h5>
      <p> In the past two weeks, over in the weekend I booted up Steam and decided to play a select-few of my Steam games I ever played ever. One of those was Empire at War and oh boy, it was
       amazing. I enjoyed every second of it. Empire at War is a . I just loved seeing the diverse ships from the iconic TIEs to the Victory-class Star Destroyer and B-Wings, the fact that it still had Legends
       content felt unreal too... </p>

      <p> Quick Pair Programming excercise, this time we had to make a program that'll be able to solve mazes. There were different levels to this, and each level can be accessed through different means. </p>
